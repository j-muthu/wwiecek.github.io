I am a researcher working on applied problems in health, epidemiology, and development economics. I am a Consulting Director at [DIL UChicago](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/development-innovation-lab/), working with a recent Nobel prize winner Michael Kremer. I also do my own grant-funded research (supported by Emergent Ventures, Open Philantrophy, and Schmidt Futures) and work with various reseach groups. In my work I focus on biostats and Bayesian methods. See a complete bio on the [About](About) page and recent projects [here](projects).
