I am a researcher working on applied problems in health, epidemiology, and development economics. I do grant-funded work with various universities and research groups, as well as private consulting. I have a PhD in statistics, with focus on biostats and Bayesian methods. I am a winner of [Emergent Ventures prize](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures) for work on COVID (2020), and my work on Bayesian statistics has been funded by direct grants from [Schmidt Futures](https://schmidtfutures.com/) (2019), [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/) (2022), and [FTX Future Fund](https://ftxfuturefund.org/) (2022, oops). See more on [About](About) page.

A lot of my recent work is focused on stats issues in development, primarily with colleagues at Development Innovation Lab at UChicago, where I am a Consulting Director, working with a recent Nobel prize winner Michael Kremer. Iâ€™ve also been a research advisor for [1Day Sooner](https://1daysooner.org/), a human challenge trial advocacy group, and I am working on [Bayesian meta-analysis methods](https://github.com/wwiecek/baggr/).

As a consultant in health care at Certara (2014-2022) I worked in all stages of drug development, with focus on improving Bayesian modelling techniques in predicting real-world effectiveness of treatments, health technology assessment, and epidemiological modelling of infectious diseases.

<!-- I studied Mathematics (BSci, MSci at AGH), specialising in algorithmic theory, graph theory, probability. I hold a PhD in statistics from UHasselt. [My thesis](https://ibiostat.be/publications/phd/witoldwiecek.pdf) was on Bayesian hierarchical modelling and Bayesian networks. -->
