I am a researcher working on applied problems in health, epidemiology, and development economics. I do grant-funded work on my own research, as well as collaborating with academics, non-profits and consulting in health/pharma. My background is in statistics (PhD focusing on biostats and Bayesian methods). 

I am a Consulting Director at Development Innovation Lab at UChicago, working with a recent Nobel prize winner Michael Kremer on studies of water quality interventions and deworming, as well as supporting the lab in statistical methods. Iâ€™m also passionate about making [Bayesian meta-analysis methods](https://github.com/wwiecek/baggr/) more accessible to social scientists and how statistical inference can support effective altruist causes. My own research has been funded by grants from [Schmidt Futures](https://schmidtfutures.com/) (2019), [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/) (2022), and [FTX Future Fund](https://ftxfuturefund.org/) (2022, oops). 

Since 2020 I have also been working on COVID, including [fractional dosing of vaccines](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116932119), [accelerating supply](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6534/1107.summary), and supporting human challenge trials (as an advisor to [1Day Sooner](https://www.1daysooner.org/)). For my work on COVID I was awarded an [Emergent Ventures prize](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures).

As a consultant in health care at Certara (2014-2022) I worked in all stages of drug development, with focus on improving Bayesian modelling techniques in predicting real-world effectiveness of treatments, health technology assessment, and epidemiological modelling of infectious diseases.

<!-- I studied Mathematics (BSci, MSci at AGH), specialising in algorithmic theory, graph theory, probability. I hold a PhD in statistics from UHasselt. [My thesis](https://ibiostat.be/publications/phd/witoldwiecek.pdf) was on Bayesian hierarchical modelling and Bayesian networks. -->
