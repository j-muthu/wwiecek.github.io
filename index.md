_Bayesian statistician and consultant --- London --- Research Fellow at **London School of Economics (STICERD)** --- Independent Consultant at **Certara** (pharmacometric and health economic consulting) --- Scientific Collaborator at **Hasselt University** (Centre for Statistics)_ 

**Short bio:** I studied Mathematics (2009-2014, BSci & MSci, University of Science & Technology, Kraków) and specialised in algorithmic theory and graph theory. I work on predictive, patient-level modelling of real world drug effectiveness, Bayesian hierarchical models, (network) meta-analyses, infectious disease models, survival analysis. At LSE our research is focussed on using Bayesian inference for modelling heterogeneity in treatment effects, including an R package development for evidence synthesis with Stan, with advice from Andrew Gelman, (Columbia University) and Dean Karlan (Northwestern Uni). I plan to defend my PhD, “Innovative methodology for Bayesian hierarchical modelling, with applications in biology and toxicology”, at Hasselt University in autumn 2019.
