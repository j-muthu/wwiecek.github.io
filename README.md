For information on formatting posts, see [here](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/text-and-typography/). Some basic info is below:

At the start of the post, here are the options you can use (non-exhaustive but most of the useful ones):
```
---
layout: post # seems to be entirely redundant
title: "Clinical trials for accelerating pandemic vaccines"
date: 2022-12-27
math: true # NOTE that to render $ as a dollar sign (either in normal text or mathjax), you need to precede it with a double backslash: \\$
categories: [Category, Subcategory]
tags: [tag]
pin: # true or false
image:
  path: # directory within github file structure
  alt: # caption
---
```
Another important thing to note is that the "Contents" at the right hand side of the posts only display headings that are of ## size or larger. UNLESS there is a ### size heading below a ## (or larger) heading, in which case the "Contents" displays it as a sub-section/sub-heading underneath the ## heading.


# Chirpy Starter

[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/jekyll-theme-chirpy)][gem]&nbsp;
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cotes2020/chirpy-starter.svg?color=blue)][mit]

When installing the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] theme through [RubyGems.org][gem], Jekyll can only read files in the folders
`_data`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets`, as well as a small part of options of the `_config.yml` file
from the theme's gem. If you have ever installed this theme gem, you can use the command
`bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy` to locate these files.

The Jekyll team claims that this is to leave the ball in the user’s court, but this also results in users not being
able to enjoy the out-of-the-box experience when using feature-rich themes.

To fully use all the features of **Chirpy**, you need to copy the other critical files from the theme's gem to your
Jekyll site. The following is a list of targets:

```shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _plugins
├── _tabs
└── index.html
```

To save you time, and also in case you lose some files while copying, we extract those files/configurations of the
latest version of the **Chirpy** theme and the [CD][CD] workflow to here, so that you can start writing in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of
the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed.

## Installation

Sign in to GitHub and [**use this template**][use-template] to generate a brand new repository and name it
`USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

Then clone it to your local machine and run:

```console
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).
